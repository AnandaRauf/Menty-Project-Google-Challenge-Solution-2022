Ananda Rauf and Harsh Sharma together build this website which works using google technology.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The main goals of building this website:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1- We are trying to use AI (technology) to help people cope up with their depression/lonliness problems. 

2- We are trying to integrate the beautiful quotes of some famous spiritual books to help teens and young adults making better decisions in life.

3- The project is not so much advanced yet, we tried to integrate some common expressions of happiness,sadness and normal eye blink to make it more human like and attractive, but still lot of work is yet to be done to make it more adavance.

4- This is just the MVP of our idea and we will keep on enhancing it with time.

5- As we both are college students we are trying to learn different things one by one to implement those into out website.
